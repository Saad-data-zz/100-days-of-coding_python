#Day 1.1 (1st coding assignment)
"""Instructions
Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson 
using what you have learnt about the Python print function.
Warning: The output in your program should match the example
output shown below exactly, character for character,
even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass."""

#Day 1.2 (2nd coding assignment)
"""Instructions
Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code.
Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
Warning: The output in your program should match the example output
shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and
symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.
Example Output
When you run your program, it should print the following:

String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n."""
