Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g.
if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3.
Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
Example Input
39
Example Output
3 + 9 = 12

#Rule for Mathematical Operators
# (3) (2) parantheses
# 3 ** 2 Exponent
# 3 * 2 multiplication
# 3 / 2 divide
# 3 + 2 Addition
# 3 - 2 subtraction

#we follow the Sequence of PEMDAS
#here the important thing the pirorty is same for follow to solve
 #parantheses and exponent
 #Multiplication and divide
 #add and subtract
 #lets have a example
print(3 * 3 + 3/3-3) #guess teh output before you run the code
#steps how python solves it multiple, divide, add and subtract.
#as told that multiple and divide are equally important but the
#sloving rule follow left --> right

#Now the same line of code will give you the out of 3
#by just changing the pirorties using PEMDAS
print(3 * (3 + 3)/3-3)
#here  python will solve the parantheses first then multiple, divide, add and subtract

"""Instructions
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI)
from a user's weight and height.
The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. 
e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount,
the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg)
by the square of their height (in m):
Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.
Example Input
weight = 80
height = 1.75
Example Output
80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

"""Instructions
I was reading this article by Tim Urban -
Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days,
 weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly,
 even the positions of the commas and full stops.
Example Input
56
Example Output
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left."""
